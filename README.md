# ENGR4450 - Applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tutorials

Welcome to the official repository for **ENGR4450 - Applied Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, a course offered at **Işık University**. This repository contains six Jupyter notebooks (tutorials) prepared by **Burak KILIC**, the course assistant, under the supervision of **Assoc. Prof. Ali Taner KUZU**.

## Course Tutorials

This repository contains the following tutorials, each focusing on key topics in applied artificial intelligence:

1. **1_intro_to_linear_models_and_scikit_learn.ipynb**  
   An introduction to linear models and an overview of the `scikit-learn` library for AI and machine learning in Python.

2. **2_linear_models.ipynb**  
   Detailed exploration of linear models including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet.

3. **3_k_nearest_neighbors.ipynb**  
   Explanation and implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

4. **4_support_vector_machines.ipynb**  
   A guide to Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for classification and regression tasks.

5. **5_neural_networks.ipynb**  
   Introduction to artificial neural networks (ANNs), covering the basics of perceptrons and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).

6. **6_convolutional_neural_networks.ipynb**  
   An introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), designed for image classification tasks.

## Sources

The primary source of reference for the tutorials is the official [scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html). Other sources have also been used where necessary, and appropriate references are provided within the relevant sections of the tutorials.
