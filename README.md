# ENGR4450 - Applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tutorials

Welcome to the official repository for **ENGR4450 - Applied Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, a course offered at **Işık University**. This repository contains six Jupyter notebooks (tutorials) prepared by **Burak KILIC**, the course assistant, under the supervision of **Assoc. Prof. Ali Taner KUZU**.

## Course Tutorials

This repository contains the following tutorials, each focusing on key topics in applied artificial intelligence:

- **1_intro_to_linear_models_and_scikit_learn.ipynb**  
   An introduction to linear models and an overview of the `scikit-learn` library for AI and machine learning in Python.

- **2_linear_models.ipynb**  
   Detailed exploration of linear models including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet.

- **3_k_nearest_neighbors.ipynb**  
   Explanation and implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

- **4_support_vector_machines.ipynb**  
   A guide to Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for classification and regression tasks.

- **5_neural_networks.ipynb**  
   Introduction to artificial neural networks (ANNs), covering the basics of perceptrons and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).

- **6_convolutional_neural_networks.ipynb**  
   An introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), designed for image classification tasks.

## Installation

To run these notebooks locally, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/engr4450-ai-course.git
cd engr4450-ai-course
```
2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

It is recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
```
3. Install dependencies

All required dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook

Once dependencies are installed, launch Jupyter Notebook to access the tutorials:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
This will open Jupyter in your default web browser. You can navigate to the notebooks and run them interactively.


## Sources

The primary source of reference for the tutorials is the official [scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html). Other sources have also been used where necessary, and appropriate references are provided within the relevant sections of the tutorials.
